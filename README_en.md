# 📖 Description
This repository contains examples of Game Design Documents (GDD) created in Obsidian. The materials are intended solely to demonstrate game design skills and documentation organization.

## ⚠ Important
This is **not** a public project, but a part of a personal portfolio. Certain details (formulas, calculations, unique mechanics) are deliberately omitted or simplified to comply with NDA and protect future releases.

# 🛠 How to View

1.  Install Obsidian (<a href="https://obsidian.md/">official website</a>).
2.  Clone this repository or download it as a `.zip` archive.
3.  Launch Obsidian.
4.  Select "Open folder as vault" and choose the repository folder.
5.  Go to *Settings → Community plugins* and enable them.
6.  Start exploring the documentation from the `!Точка входа` file.

#### Note
Obsidian works with `.md` files, which can also be viewed directly on GitHub, **but with limited functionality, styling, and most importantly — without working internal links**.

### 🔧 macOS Specific Notes
The repository includes a service folder called `.obsidian`, which contains:
*   Your workspace settings.
*   Plugin configurations.
*   Custom templates and snippets.

By default, macOS hides folders that start with a dot (`.`), which may lead to errors, especially with missing plugins. While this won’t prevent you from opening the vault, it may affect visual consistency and readability. A common issue is folder name conflicts (e.g., `.obsidian2`, `.obsidian3`, etc.).
> 💡 To help troubleshoot these issues more easily, make sure hidden folders are visible in Finder.

### ✅ Solutions
<details>
<summary>Method 1: Full reset (recommended)</summary>
1.  Delete the entire vault folder (the one with duplicate `.obsidian` folders).  
2.  Re-clone the repository.  
3.  Only then open the folder in Obsidian.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Method 2: Manual fix</summary>

2.  Delete the local `.obsidian` folder.  
3.  Rename `.obsidian2` to `.obsidian`.
