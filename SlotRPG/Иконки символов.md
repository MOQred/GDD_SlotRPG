> [!Soup] **Prompt** 
> A pop-art style icon of a torn, decayed spellbook with thick, inky outlines and bright yet spooky colors. Tattered pages, maybe a skull symbol on the cover or glowing runes, exuding an undead or cursed atmosphere. Keep the shading simple and graphic, reminiscent of a bold comic poster, with minimal background."

> [!Cross] **Negative Prompt** 
> photorealistic, realistic, hyperrealistic, 3D render, watermark, signature, big text blocks, overly detailed environment, cutesy, pastel, disfigured shapes

> [!Soup] **Prompt** 
> A pop-art style icon of a rotting heart with thick black outlines, bold color blocks, and slight decay details. The colors are vibrant yet eerie—perhaps greenish or purple highlights—giving it an undead, ominous vibe. Emphasize simplified comic-like shading, no realistic gore, just stylized rot and drips. No background detail, focusing on the striking undead heart design.
