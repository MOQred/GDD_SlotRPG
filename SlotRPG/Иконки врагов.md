Противника рисуем по грудь. Под ним поместим хп бар, атаку и описание абилки. Так же для врагов рисуем уникальные баблы, в которые они будут выкрикивать реплики.

> [!Soup] **Prompt** 
> Pop-art style concept art of a decaying zombie thrall, shown in 3/4 view from the waist up. Slightly simplified, cartoon-like details: tattered rags, rotting flesh, minimal gore but with an undead aura. Bold outlines and bright yet eerie colors reminiscent of a comic poster. The figure stands with a drooping posture, holding a broken weapon. Clean background, focusing on the stylized undead design, not overly complex.

> [!Soup] **Prompt** 
> A pop-art style concept illustration of a cunning ork tactician, 3/4 angle, waist-up. Slightly simplified cartoon shapes, thick comic outlines, bright colors. He has green skin, rough armor, and a war banner or spiked club. Emphasize his sly expression, referencing 'taktikul' planning. No extensive background; focus on the stylized ork figure in a bold, comic-like fashion.

> [!Soup] **Prompt** 
> Pop-art style fantasy illustration of a skeletal bone warlock, shown in 3/4 view from the waist up. Bold comic outlines, bright saturated colors, but with slightly more intricate details than a simple cartoon: arcane runes glowing along his bony arms, faint magical aura swirling around him, a gnarled staff etched with occult symbols. He should wear a hooded robe with layered accessories (chains, talismans), exuding ominous energy. Keep the outlines thick and stylized shading reminiscent of comic posters, but include enough small details to make him look powerful rather than plain. Minimal background so the warlock’s vibrant, menacing design stands out.
